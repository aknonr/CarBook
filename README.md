 CarBook Project

CarBook is a car rental web application that leverages modern software architectural patterns and technologies. The project is built using Onion Architecture, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), Mediator, Repository Pattern, JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication, SignalR for real-time communication, Pivot Tables for data organization, DTO (Data Transfer Objects) for efficient data handling, and Fluent Validation for robust input validation.

## Tech I use
- C#
- .Net Core 8.0
- Onion Architecture: Ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes a maintainable and testable codebase.
- CQRS: Segregates the operations that read data from the operations that write data, improving performance and scalability.
- Mediator: Decouples the request handling by encapsulating the requests and responses.
- Repository Pattern: Abstracts the data access logic and provides a flexible approach to data persistence.
- JSON Web Token (JWT): Secures the application by providing a stateless authentication mechanism.
- SignalR: Enables real-time communication between the server and the clients.
- Pivot Table: Organizes and summarizes complex data relationships for better insights.
- DTO (Data Transfer Objects): Facilitates efficient data transfer between layers.
- Fluent Validation: Implements strong validation rules for incoming data.
- MSSQL
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JS
- JQuery
